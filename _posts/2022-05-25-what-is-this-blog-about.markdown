Well altough I have no content here yet, since you're already here I'd like to welcome you to my personal dev blog! I'll be posting guides and ramblings about software development here very frequently, and you may get your updates through the [RSS Feed](/feed.xml). This blog focuses on minimalism, free software and free stuff (because I'm a very cheap person).

If you want to know how to develop minimalistic web, desktop, and mobile software and learn about hosting stuff on the internet for free this blog will help you guide you through it. I expect to release my first guides this week, hopefully they are already accessible now that you're reading this.

If you wonder why I write this if no one is reading this website yet: I want to test the RSS feed and my RSS reader configuration.

See ya later,

Doodles
