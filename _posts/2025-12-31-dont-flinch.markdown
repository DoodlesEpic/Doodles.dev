New Year is the most wonderful time of the year, or so it might seem. An entire year of successes and failures, victories and losses, mistakes and learnings comes to an end, with the promise of a new chance at life. Whenever you're given that chance: don't flinch.

## There is no new year

The idea that a number changing from 2025 to 2026 will make any difference to your life is... weird. Sure, society is structured around days, weeks, months, years... However, these are simply a way to keep the passing of time more tangible. The truth is, the clock marking 11:59PM isn't anything special. In fact, it might already be New Year in another place on the globe whenever you start hearing fireworks or see that last clock tick that marks the end of this cycle. Then, why are you waiting?

Especially as an engineer-type, planning everything seems natural, and using dates such as the 1st of January as a marker for something might even make sense from the point of view of organization, but don't fall for the illusion that your plans would pan out any differently if you had started them mid-year. In fact, perhaps you'd be finished by now if you weren't aiming for such perfection.

Life is short. Above all, life is unpredictable. Your next year might not be exactly what you're planning. I bet you haven't accomplished all of your last year's New Year's resolutions, have you? So stop with that. Get moving. Don't flinch. Stop looking at the clock and waiting for the right time to do something, and make sure you use this short reading as the motivation you needed to go to the gym, learn a new programming language, or talk to that person you've been waiting for. (or whatever you've been delaying for so long as if there would be a magic moment, someday, where you would suddenly get started).

## Get going

Happy New Year! Here's hoping that you won't wait for the next New Year to get going with your life plans and dreams.

And as always, have a good one!
