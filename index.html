  Hello, my name is Eduardo, but you can call me Doodles. Welcome to my little
  personal website with blog posts, projects, and contact information. Just
  minimalistic pages with no JavaScript and lots of content. Make yourself at
  home.
</p>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>
  I'm a young Brazillian full-stack software developer. I've been coding for
  nearly six years already and have worked on websites, web apps, desktop
  applications, mobile apps, and embedded devices, including robotics
  applications.
</p>

<p>
  I develop my projects mostly for the fun of learning. I believe that privacy,
  security, and freedom are important. I'm a big enthusiast of free software, so
  most of my code is licensed either under some GNU GPL or MIT License. I also
  contribute to open-source software in my free time.
</p>
